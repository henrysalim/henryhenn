## Hi, there!ðŸ‘‹

<p>
  My name is Henry Salim, I'm from Indonesia. Currently, I'm a third-year student at Cinta Kasih Tzu Chi Vocational High School majoring Software Engineering.
  I'm 18 years old, and I start to code by C# when I was 15. One year later, I was interested in web programming, especially using PHP language. I do really like Laravel Framework,
  because of it's beauty and joy to write code with it.
